![Thought Map 1](map1.png "Fundemental Break Down of how the engine funtions")


# other diagrams
these are all of them they could be old
i just put them all here beacuse i want to see the evelotion of everything
![Diagram of how the game objects and scene interact with each other](bd.png "Scene & GameObject Interaction BreakDown")

# about how the engine fundemently functions
the classes will be able to be created and used individualy however they can also function under the game engine instance
that will manage all of them so they can interact more efficently

# im verry new to c++
i am but i really like the launge everytime i learn more i like it even more then i did before
but this dose brings some draw backs beacuse i was wrrting deffs in hpp files witch is NOT good
so i have to rewrite hpp files & make src files now

# game loopðŸ¥€
i want games made with this to be able to run at a high frame rate but the frame rate dosent not affect the main game loop like timed things
and mostly pysicys beacues that means velicotys like every objectes vel and the camera will be all messed up
perhaps multi threading is the soultion?
